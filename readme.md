# Jokes Fetch - API using Promises

In this project, we display random jokes using the following API : https://icanhazdadjoke.com
we have built this project using Promises.

### JS Promises

Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code. We use the JS Promises to fetch the API and display the data. (The code commented in the main.js file is a simple way of using promise)

### JS Async and Await using error handling

The async function declaration declares an async function where the await keyword is permitted within the function body. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style.
